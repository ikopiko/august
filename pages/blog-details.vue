                                    <p>Through solution-based therapy, I learned about a pair of questions that can help you identify exactly what you need to do to move forward each day. I’ve been asking myself these questions every night, right before bed — research shows that our brains can make creative connections while we sleep — and I’ve noticed an incredible difference in my mood and outlook. Try them yourself:
                                        On a scale of 1–10, how happy are you with your life today?</p>
                                    <p>Don’t dwell on the question too much. You don’t need to provide a list of reasons why — just give a number based on your gut feeling.
                                        If your answer is 10, congratulations. There’s no need for you to be here.</p>
                                    <p>If it’s anything less than 10, here comes the next part: Take whatever number you came up with and add one.
                                        Now ask yourself another question:</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Why just add one? Because it’s achievable. If you add more than that Cool Pastry
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>The wording is important. The question “What would be different?” sends your brain on a mission to search for small, achievable changes you can implement to make your life just a little bit better the next day. Maybe you’ll decide to get outdoors for 20 minutes, or call an old friend for a quick catch-up session.
                                        Do this consistently over the weeks and months and those changes will start to add up.</p>

                                    <p>If you add more than that — if you try to go from a 3 to a 9, for example — you’ll probably feel anxious about the huge undertaking and decide to put it off for later.
